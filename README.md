# Cat Herd

A nostr client for scheduling and finding in-person meetups

Cat Herd utilizes custom event kinds to facilitate creating meetup groups, scheduling meetup events for these groups, joining groups, and RSVPing for groups. You can find our [relay implementation here](https://github.com/terminus-btc/nostr-meetup-relay) which is a proof of concept for how these new event kinds could work.
